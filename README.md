# Barsoom Heavy Industries Modifications
A collection of ASTIC scripts for the various ships I use that I have collected, modified, and/or written. The ASTIC mod is needed for these to work, and you can get it at https://github.com/GitHub-TC/EmpyrionScripting. For MP servers, things that do not require server side config or savegame access should work.



## Structure
For Vollinger's Nomax and it's modules, go into the Nomax folder, and each module will have it's own folder.
